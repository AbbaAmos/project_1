        US lures foreign tech talents with flexible visa rules, to sustain it's economy
      </h1>

      <p class="subtitle"> <strong>
        US universities are reputable for attracting thousands of international students each year but the number of student visa approvals over the last 11 years favors foreign students in STEM-related fields who might stay back, deploy their skills, and build its economy.</strong>

     </p>

<p>For the second year in a row, the number of US student visas to international students did not cross the 1 million mark in 2021 but this did not deter US officials from opening its borders to foreign students from Asia in large numbers.
   China, India and South Korea received over 50 percent of the total visa <a href="https://www.ice.gov/sevis/whats-new#dataLibrary"></a>approvals</a> compared to  successful visa applicants from over 190 countries.</p><br>
</p>
<p>
<p>Foreign students are the US's primary source of tech talent to build up its labor force, especially in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, (STEM) fields.</p><br>

<p>China was the largest recipient of student visa approvals and remains the biggest contributor of foreign students to the US with one-third of the population of international students since 2010.</p><br>

<p>The dataset captures three visa types F-1, M-1, and J-1 issued to foreign students who were studying at US universities from 2010 to 2021 as compiled by the US Department of Homeland Security, DHS.</p><br>


<p>Some foreign students who acquire advanced degrees in the US after completing their schooling choose to remain in the country to compete in the labor market pool rather than return to their home countries.</p><br>

<p>Optional Practical Training, OPT allows international students to work for a year in a field related to their academic focus which can be extended for a 24-month period is a primary way foreign students on F-1 visas transition into the US labor force but it is reserved for students in STEM fields.</p><br>

<p>International students has made significant contributions to the US economy, according to data from the US Commerce Department foreign students pumped $32 billion into the economy in 2021.</p><br>

<iframe title="Number of foreign students issued US study visas in 11 years  " aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-92GBc" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/92GBc/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="446" data-external="1"></iframe>

<p>The population of the US labor force is 164 million (2021 estimates), foreign workers make up 17 percent of the total workforce which is less than one-fifth of the employed population based on figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p><br>
  Though, foreign workers occupy less than 20 percent slice of the labor force, they have higher participation rates in specialized STEM sectors.</p><br>

<p>Looking at the dataset, the number of visa approvals by the State Department for a given academic session does not always correlate with the actual number of students studying in the US within the given academic session.</p><br>

<p>For example, the State Department approved 83,888 student visas for Mexico in 2021  but the actual number of Mexican students accounted for the 2021/2022 academic session was put at 14,500 which is 17 percent of the total approved visas.</p><br>

<iframe title="Popular Fields of Study Among International Students in the US in 2020  " aria-label="Grouped Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-KcmFk" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/KcmFk/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="400" data-external="1"></iframe>
<p>In 2020, 94,953 student visas were approved for Mexico which outweighs the actual number of students of 12,986 which is 14 percent of actual students studying in the US for the same year could be attributed to Covid-19 restrictions.</p><br>

<p>The DHS explains in a caveat in the footnote of the database that the number of student visa approvals also includes the children and spouses of successful applicants.</p><br>

<p>The database also contains a category labeled as “unknown” for persons who receive student visas but whose status was not revealed.
  A research study says International STEM graduates have a 20 percent chance of joining the US labor force while the chances of non-STEM graduates becoming employed are not statistically different from zero.</p><br>

  <p>I could not track the exact time of transition of foreign students into the labor force from the dataset or point out substantial differences across fields that shows the average waiting time a foreign student who remains in the US would find a job.
