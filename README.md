US lures foreign tech talents with flexible visa rules, to preserve it's wealth

The project seeks to establish countries with the largest share of U.S. Immigrant student visas in the last decade and the impact of international students on the U.S high skilled labor market.

Investigation

I made use of data from the Department of Homeland Security U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Bureau of Labor Statistics to determine: - Countries who are the major beneficiaries of US student visas over a eleven-year period from 2010 to 2021 which include China,Canada, Mexico and India.
Also the number of US student visa approvals for some countries was always more than actual students studying in the US. Mexico was one of such countries where of the total approved student visas of 83,888 only 17 percent made it to class in 2019.


Data Collection Procedures

I made use of dataset of student visa approvals from 2010 to 2020 from the Department of Homeland Security website. I limited the records from 2010 to 2021 to ensure I counted vaalid visa approvals but excluded a category called unknown as immigrants who got the student visas but there was no information that could be gathered about their status.I downloaded the year-by-year data of student visa approvals from the website which I saved into a CSV. I filtered the data to establish the top countries.

Lessons

I had assumptions about the dataset which made me form my hypothesis that Asian countries had the highest rates of student visa approvals as Canada and Mexico behind China. This shows that cross refrecining different datasets will can produce a trnd or pattern to help in analysis
